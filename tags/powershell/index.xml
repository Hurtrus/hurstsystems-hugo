      <title>PowerShell - Adding WhatIf and Confirm</title>

      <description>So I planned to write a blog post about how to add WhatIf and Confirm to your PowerShell code and began to do research on the topic. I found that a bunch of awesome blogs that already had covered this topic, so I grabbed some information about each and threw it into this post. I will clean this up and make it more readable at a later time, just wanted to get this into my site so that I could find it and use it when needed.</description>

      <description>PowerShell - Error Handling Try Catch and Finally
Try When we need to watch a block of our code for errors, our new best friend is the try statement. Ever dillagent, try knows the danger that looms and is looking out for you when a &amp;ldquo;terminating&amp;rdquo; error occurs.
We can also tell try to be on the lookout for other types of errors, those errrors that don&amp;rsquo;t stop the function in its tracks (also known as Non-Terminating), but may cause problems later in our code because this function was unable to be successfully executed.</description>

      <title>PowerShell - Pester Notes</title>
      <link>https://hurst.systems/posts/powershell-pester-notes/</link>

      <description>Pester Time to learn Pester. Not so much a blog post as it is a reading/reference list. What is Pester? &amp;ldquo;Pester is the ubiquitous test and mock framework for PowerShell&amp;rdquo; or in other words, tests written to test the functions you have created without actually running those commands.
Are you asking yourself &amp;ldquo;why bother? just run the code and see if it works?&amp;rdquo; Yeah me too, but seems like everyone is doing it&amp;hellip; so might as well jump off a bridge also, hopefully by the end I will see its value.</description>

      <description>In the beginning&amp;hellip;
This blog is probably well over due, if for no other reason than just keeping track of the things I learn in PowerShell so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget them later. This &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; might even work great in keeping track of those little details that make different commands work..just so&amp;hellip; I might even remember that I wrote down those little gotchas in a place to remind myself.</description>
